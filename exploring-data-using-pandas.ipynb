We will focus on using [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) which is an open-source package for data analysis in Python. pandas is an excellent toolkit for working with *real world data* that often have a tabular structure (rows and columns).\n\nWe will first get familiar with the pandas data structures: *DataFrame* and *Series*:\n\n![pandas data structures](img/pandas-structures.png)\n\n- **pandas DataFrame** (a 2-dimensional data structure) is used for storing and mainpulating table-like data (data with rows and columns) in Python. You can think of a pandas DataFrame as a programmable spreadsheet. \n- **pandas Series** (a 1-dimensional data structure) is used for storing and manipulating a sequence of values. pandas Series is kind of like a list, but more clever. One row or one column in a pandas DataFrame is actually a pandas Series. \n\nThese pandas structures incorporate a number of things we've already encountered, such as indices, data stored in a collection, and data types. Let's have another look at the pandas data structures below with some additional annotation.\n\n![pandas data structures annotated](img/pandas-structures-annotated.png)\n\nAs you can see, both DataFrames and Series in pandas have an index that can be used to select values, but they also have column labels to identify columns in DataFrames. In the lesson this week we'll use many of these features to explore real-world data and learn some useful data analysis procedures.\n\nFor a comprehensive overview of pandas data structures you can have a look at [Chapter 5](https://wesmckinney.com/book/pandas-basics) in Wes McKinney's book [Python for Data Analysis (3rd Edition, 2022)](https://wesmckinney.com/book/) and the [pandas online documentation about data structures](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/dsintro.html).\n\n**Note**: pandas is a \"high-level\" package, which means that it makes use of several other packages such as [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) in the background. There are several ways in which data can be read from a file in Python, and for several years now we have decided to focus primarily on pandas because it is easy-to-use, efficient and intuitive. If you are curoius about other approaches for interacting with data files, you can find lesson materials from previous years about reading data using [NumPy](https://geo-python-site.readthedocs.io/en/2018.1/notebooks/L5/numpy/1-Exploring-data-using-numpy.html#Reading-a-data-file-with-NumPy) or [built-in Python functions](https://geo-python-site.readthedocs.io/en/2017.1/lessons/L5/reading-data-from-file.html).\n\n## Input data: weather statistics\n\nOur input data is a text file containing weather observations from Kumpula, Helsinki, Finland retrieved from [NOAA](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/)*:\n\n- File name: [Kumpula-June-2016-w-metadata.txt](Kumpula-June-2016-w-metadata.txt) (have a look at the file before reading it in using pandas!)\n- The file is available in the binder and CSC notebook instances, under the L5 folder \n- The data file contains observed daily mean, minimum, and maximum temperatures from June 2016 recorded from the Kumpula weather observation station in Helsinki.\n- There are 30 rows of data in this sample data set.\n- The data has been derived from a data file of daily temperature measurments downloaded from [NOAA](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/).\n\n\\*US National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration's National Centers for Environmental Information climate database\n\n## Reading a data file with pandas\n\nNow we're ready to read in our temperature data file. First, we need to import the pandas module. It is customary to import pandas as `pd`:","metadata":{"deletable":true,"editable":true}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd","metadata":{"tags":[],"deletable":true,"editable":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Next, we'll read the input data file, and store the contents of that file in a variable called `data` Using the `pandas.read_csv()` function:","metadata":{"deletable":true,"editable":true}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Read the file using pandas\ndata = pd.read_csv(\"Kumpula-June-2016-w-metadata.txt\", sep=\",\")","metadata":{"tags":[],"collapsed":false,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"deletable":true,"editable":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Delimiter and other optional parameters\n\nOur input file is a comma-delimited file; columns in the data are separted by commas (`,`) on each row. The pandas `.read_csv()` function has the comma as the default delimiter so we don't need to specify it separately. In order to make the delimiter visible also in the code for reading the file, could add the `sep` parameter:\n    \n```python\ndata = pd.read_csv('Kumpula-June-2016-w-metadata.txt', sep=`,`)\n```\n    \nThe `sep` parameter can be used to specify whether the input data uses some other character, such as `;` as a delimiter. For a full list of available parameters, please refer to the [pandas documentation for pandas.read_csv](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html), or run `help(pd.read_csv)`.","metadata":{"jp-MarkdownHeadingCollapsed":true,"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Reading different file formats\n\n`pandas.read_csv()` is a general function for reading data files separated by commas, spaces, or other common separators. \n\npandas has several different functions for parsing input data from different formats. There is, for example, a separate function for reading Excel files `read_excel`. Another useful function is `read_pickle` for reading data stored in the [Python pickle format](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html). Check out the [pandas documentation about input and output functions](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html#io-tools-text-csv-hdf5) and [Chapter 6](https://wesmckinney.com/book/accessing-data) in McKinney (2022) for more details about reading data.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"If all goes as planned, you should now have a new variable `data` in memory that contains the input data. \n\nLet's check the the contents of this variable by calling `data` or `print(data)`:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data","metadata":{"tags":[],"collapsed":false,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"deletable":true,"editable":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"execution_count":3,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"       # Data file contents: Daily temperatures (mean            min  \\\n0                 #                     for June 1-30           2016   \n1   # Data source: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-w...
